# Machine Learning - NLP: Transformer & BERT Fine-Tuning

## Overview
This notebook explores two fundamental areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP):
1. **Implementing a Transformer Model from Scratch**: This section involves constructing a Transformer-based architecture step by step, breaking down its key components and their role in sequence modeling.
2. **Fine-Tuning BERT using LoRA**: We utilize Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to optimize the fine-tuning process of the pre-trained BERT model, making it computationally efficient for domain-specific tasks.

## Objectives
- Develop an in-depth understanding of the Transformer model architecture.
- Implement key Transformer components, including attention mechanisms, embeddings, and feed-forward layers.
- Learn the significance of fine-tuning large language models using parameter-efficient methods like LoRA.
- Apply BERT fine-tuning techniques to enhance performance on specific NLP tasks.

## Dependencies & Installation
To ensure compatibility, install the following dependencies before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install datasets torchmetrics torch transformers
```

## Key Components
### 1. Transformer Model Implementation
- **Token Embeddings & Positional Encoding**: Encoding input sequences to maintain word representations and positional context.
- **Multi-Head Self-Attention Mechanism**: Implementing self-attention across multiple heads to capture diverse contextual relationships.
- **Feed-Forward Layers & Layer Normalization**: Applying transformations and normalization for stable training.
- **Transformer Encoder Stacking**: Building deep stacked layers to enhance model expressiveness and generalization.

### 2. BERT Fine-Tuning with LoRA
- **Utilizing Pre-trained BERT from Hugging Face**: Leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models for NLP applications.
- **Applying LoRA for Efficient Parameter Updates**: Reducing computational cost by adapting only select parameters.
- **Task-Specific Training & Performance Evaluation**: Fine-tuning BERT for downstream tasks such as classification or named entity recognition (NER).

## Execution Steps
1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and properly set up.
2. Run all cells sequentially to guarantee correct initialization.
3. Implement Transformer model components and validate their outputs.
4. Fine-tune the BERT model using LoRA, optimizing for domain-specific tasks.
5. Evaluate model performance using relevant NLP metrics.

## Notes
- The entire implementation is based on **PyTorch**, and usage of TensorFlow is **not permitted** to maintain consistency.
- Before submission, ensure all cells have been executed to validate reproducibility and correctness.
- LoRA fine-tuning provides a computationally efficient way to adapt BERT, making it suitable for real-world applications where full model fine-tuning is infeasible.
